## Question 1
This is Exercise 1 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem 1a
Find the correlation coefficient, *r*, for the following sample data on income and education:
```{r}
library(knitr)
obs <- seq(1:5)
income <- c(30,28,52,40,35)
edu <- c(12,13,18,16,17)
df <- data.frame(obs,income,edu)
names(df) <- c("Observation","Income ($*1000)","Education (Years)")
kable(df)
```

Solution 1a
```{r}
cor(income, edu, method = "pearson")

```


### Problem 1b
Test the null hypothesis Ï = 0.

Solution 1b
```{r}
if(cor.test(income, edu, method = "pearson")[3]$p.value > 0.05)
{
  print('Income is not related to education')
  
}
```


### Problem 1c
Find Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient for these data.

Solution 1c
```{r}
cor(income, edu, method = "spearman")
```


### Problem 1d
Test whether the observed value of rs from part (c) is significantly different from zero.

Solution 1d
```{r}
result <- cor.test(income, edu, method = "spearman",alternative = 'greater')
if (result[3]$p.value > 0.05)
{  print('Income is not related to education')
  }
```



## Question 2
This is Exercise 3 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
The distribution of the t-statistic for testing the significance of a correlation coefficient has n â€? 2 degrees of freedom. If the sample size is 36 and Î± = 0.05, what is the smallest absolute value a correlation coefficient must have to be significant? What if the sample size is 80?

### Solution
```{r}
t.36 <- qt(0.975, df = 34)
r.36 <- sqrt(t.36^2/(34 + t.36^2))
t.80 <- qt(0.975, df = 78)
r.80 <- sqrt(t.80^2/(78 + t.80^2))
print(paste("when the sample size is 36,The smallest absolute value is",round(r.36, digits = 3)))
print(paste("when the sample size is 80,The smallest absolute value is",round(r.80, digits = 3)))
```

```{r}
year <- 1984:1994
income <- c(35165,35778,37027,37256,37512,37997,37343,36054,35593,35241,35486)
races <- c(399,469,429,450,474,598,364,430,433,410,317)
df <- data.frame(year,income,races)
names(df) <- c("Year","Median income","Number of races won by leading jockey")
kable(df)
```


### Solution
```{r}
if(cor.test(income,races,method = 'pearson')[3]$p.value > 0.05)
{
  print('Number of races won by leading jockey is not related to Median income')
}
```



## Question 5
This is Exercise 7 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].

### Problem
For the following ranked data, find Spearmanâ€™s r, and then test the null hypothesis (using a Type I error probability of 0.10) that the true correlation is equal to zero.

```{r}
library(knitr)
obs <- 1:6
x <- c(1,2,5,6,11,12)
y <- c(8,4,12,3,10,7)
df <- data.frame(obs,x,y)
names(df) <- c("Observation","Rank of x","Rank of y")
kable(df)
```


### Solution
```{r}
cor(x,y,method = 'spearman')
result_new <- cor.test(x,y,method = 'spearman')[3]
if(result_new$p.value > 0.10 )
{
  print('there is no relationship between x and y')
}
```



## Question 6
This is Exercise 8 in Chapter 7 of the Textbook [R].
